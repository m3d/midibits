Experiments with MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) in Python

There are several motivations and once a while I feel like I should do
something with Yamaha PSR-520 ... a bit older machine. I use Windows 7
and preffer Python.

The MIDI protocol (the basic) is not very complicated. Useful description
